# No Longer Maintained
Okay so this repo is no longer going to be maintained. I did a lot of restructuring of my source code with a lot of changes to the UI. Going to archive this repo as "doomverse-legacy" while I work on a new, more organized, Doomverse repo. 

# Doomverse Source Code
Welcome to the source code for my project! It has been a while since I first announced this, and unfortunately due to personal life I have been unable to maintain this project. Thus, I decided to upload it to GitHub. I feel like I can't work on this project alone anymore, and a team of community members would be great. In its current state, the program is unfinished. I will keep pushing updates to this repo.
